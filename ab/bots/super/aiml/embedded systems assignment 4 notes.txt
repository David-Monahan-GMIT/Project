Timers
Refer to the ucos ii manual e-mailed by cuinas

Every system has a clock tick usually set in the cfg file
The tick ISR has to be updated to post to the Timer Task semaphore every 1/10th of a second OSTmrSignal
If the cfg is set for 50msecs per tick (Default) then it needs to post every second tick
As the callback function is executed within the timer task then there must be sufficient task space to run this.
When executing the function wrap it in enable and disable interrupts

Callback functions for the timer must be in the following format:
void MyCallback (void *ptmr, void *callback_arg) {
}
*ptmr is a pointer to the timer structure that is calling it
*callback_arg is the argument that is defined in the timer structure when creating the timer
Will need to use OSTmrSignal this is the function that posts to the semaphore must be called every second tick
Memory has to be enabled in the configuration
